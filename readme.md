# BrowserQuest Boss Mode
###NOTE: Your Existing Character Will Be Deleted (no name, sword or armor) If You Use This Extension

Inspired by [How I Cheated Mozilla's New HTML5 Game - Browser Quest](http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2012/3/28/How-I-cheated-Mozillas-new-HTML5-Game), [here is a Chrome extension](https://github.com/downloads/bootstraponline/bossmode/bossmode.crx) that allows you to be any sprite in the game.

[Click here for the Chrome extension.](https://github.com/downloads/bootstraponline/bossmode/bossmode.crx)

##Instructions
- Enter the [BrowserQuest game](http://browserquest.mozilla.org/).
- Select a sprite from the extension list, for example "boss".
- Refresh the page and enter the game as the new sprite!

##Back To Normal
- To go back to normal pick up any armor and weapon in the game. Your name will not be reset though.
- To set your name back open up the developer tools (right click then select Inspect Element), go to Local Storage and then in the "value" set name to whatever you want.

## Source
The code is open source and based on Google's [set page color example](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/examples/api/browserAction/set_page_color.zip) extension. The license is the same as the set page color example.
